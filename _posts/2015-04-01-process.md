Daily/weekly discussion happens in [`Standup` tickets](https://github.com/saxifrage/learn/labels/Standup), posted each Tuesday. The kick-off prompts are "What I accomplished last week", "What I intend to do this week", and "Obstacles that are impeding my process".

Star labels indicate priority:

 - `★★★`&mdash;default to this when deciding what to work on
 - `★★☆`&mdash;default to this when creating tickets
 - `★☆☆`&mdash;Siberia

Every ticket that's not directly related to the software itself should have a
scope label (software issues are the default ticket scope):

 - `Docs`&mdash;for this site
 - `Design`&mdash;UI/UX, Visual Assets, Wireframes, Drawings, etc.
 - `Meta`&mdash;catch-all for everything else

We use [milestones](https://github.com/saxifrage/learn/milestones) for development epics. Install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) for a kanban board.

Commit documentation directly to `master`. Things besides documentation should go through a pull request. All open PRs are assumed to be work in progress. Use the [`Review`](https://github.com/saxifrage/cityasacampus/labels/Review) label when your work is ready to review and merge.
