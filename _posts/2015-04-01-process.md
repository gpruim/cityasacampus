Daily/weekly discussion happens in [`Standup` tickets](https://github.com/saxifrage/learn/labels/Standup), posted each Tuesday. The kick-off prompts are "What I accomplished last week", "What I intend to do this week", and "Obstacles that are impeding my process".

Star labels indicate priority:

 - `★★☆`&mdash;the default; start here
 - `★★★`&mdash;high priority
 - `★☆☆`&mdash;Siberia

Every ticket that's not directly related to the software itself should have a
scope label (software issues are the default ticket scope):

 - `Docs`&mdash;for this site
 - `Design`&mdash;UI/UX, Visual Assets, Wireframes, Drawings, etc.
 - `Meta`&mdash;catch-all for everything else

We collect sprint tickets on
[milestones](https://github.com/saxifrage/learn/milestones).

PRs are assumed to be work in progress. Use the [`Review`](https://github.com/saxifrage/cityasacampus/labels/Review) label when your work is ready for review and merge.
