We run weekly sprints synced on a public Google Hangout on Fridays at 10:00 AM
(US/Eastern).

Daily discussion happens on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/saxifrage/learn) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/saxifrage/learn/issues).

Every ticket should have a priority label:

 - `★★☆`&mdash;the default; start here
 - `★★★`&mdash;high priority
 - `★☆☆`&mdash;Siberia

Every ticket that's not directly related to the software itself should have a
scope label (software issues are the default ticket scope):

 - `Docs`&mdash;for this site
 - `Design`&mdash;UI/UX, Visual Assets, Wireframes, Drawings, etc.
 - `Meta`&mdash;catch-all for everything else

We collect sprint tickets on
[milestones](https://github.com/saxifrage/learn/milestones).

We record videos of our weekly [sprint reset calls](https://www.youtube.com/user/timothyfcook/search?query=sprint).
