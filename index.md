City as Campus (CaaC) is an open-source project that implements a community- or organization-wide learning
hub. Once it is complete, you can setup a CaaC instance on its own domain, as a sub-domain with a CNAME record (e.g. www.learn.example.com), or as a native embed within your existing site (either as a full page or a small widget).

CaaC lets organizers create and manage learning opportunities with accompanying Open Badges. Opportunities then populate a community-wide database which learners are able to explore. Learners can sign-up for opportunities, earn open badges, and keep track of their learning.
